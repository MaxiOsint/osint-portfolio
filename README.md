My OSINT investigation cases, reports and data summaries (redacted)
OSINT Portfolio — Maxi_Os1nt

This repo contains fragments from real investigations I've worked on — redacted, but authentic. Focus: fraud, identity tracing, account attribution, and real-world events that required solid verification, not theory.

Cross-border fraud (Crypto, False Docs)  
Tracked individuals and entities behind a fake supply chain scheme. Started with payment receipts, ended with crypto wallets, shell domains, and full identity attribution. Case involved over $120K loss on the victim's side.  
Key angles: language patterns, export records, breached email reuse, IP trails.

Telegram-based impersonation scam  
Mapped actors behind fake "legal support" using Telegram bots, PDF forgeries, and social engineering. Pulled full names, payment methods, metadata from documents and bots.  
Started with a PDF, ended with real names and addresses.

Violent crime (location-based OSINT)  
Linked a local business to a fatal incident using ownership records, customer complaints, and social data. Found contradictions between public reports and the actual structure of the venue's management.  
Focused on patterns, not speculation.

Tools and Process  
What I use daily:
• Google dorking (smart queries matter)  
• Telegram analytics (usernames, messages, bots)  
• Breach platforms  
• Passive WHOIS & DNS  
• Entity correlation by email / phone / name  
• Python CLI tools (private use)  
• Screenshots, hashes, and archives — everything logged

I don’t publish everything. But if you’re interested in methodology, redacted details, or collab — reach out.
