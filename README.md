 Case Summaries

 Cross-border Fraud — Crypto and False Documentation

Investigated individuals and entities behind a fake import/export scheme.  
Started with leaked receipts and progressed to crypto wallet tracing, shell domains, and full identity attribution.  
Total loss on the victim's side exceeded $120,000.

**Key elements:** linguistic profiling, export records, breach reuse, passive IP/DNS data.



 Telegram Impersonation and Document Forgery

Analyzed a social engineering fraud operation involving fake legal assistance via Telegram bots and PDF forgeries.  
Used document metadata, linked usernames, and payment trails to trace back to real-world identities and locations.

Key elements: bot enumeration, metadata extraction, wallet tracking, cross-platform correlation.



 Violent Incident and Ownership Attribution

Linked a fatal physical incident to a specific business by investigating public ownership data, hidden company affiliations, and social feedback contradictions.  
Public statements diverged significantly from internal structural data.

Key elements: corporate records, business registries, location-based social data, timeline analysis.



 Methodology and Tools

- Targeted Google queries (dorking)
- Telegram analytics (botnet patterns, account clusters)
- Breach correlation (email, phone, password reuse)
- Passive WHOIS/DNS history
- Entity resolution across aliases and platforms
- Custom-built Python CLI tools for OSINT and attribution
- All sessions logged via screenshots, hashes, and metadata
